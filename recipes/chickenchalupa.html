        <p class="content">These chicken chalupas use leftover chicken, which makes a great filling. Chalupas are small, boat-shaped flatbreads that can be filled very simply, or can be served with all the usual toppings for a taco. Choose your own toppings, or use any or all of the suggestions and enjoy this south-of-the-border treat!</p>

            </ul>
            <h3 class="heading sub">Filling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups chopped iceberg lettuce</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste</li>
                <li>Optional toppings, such as pico de gallo, sour cream, or sliced avocados, to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup refried beans</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
                <li>oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the chalupa shells, combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Stir well to combine the dry ingredients.</li>
                <li>Gradually pour in milk, while stirring, until you need to use your hand to knead. Add in the melted butter, and knead well.</li>
                <li>Shape dough into 6 equal balls. Sprinkle flour over a work surface and flour the rolling pin. Roll each dough ball into about a 7-inch circle, moving the dough a quarter turn after a couple of passes with the rolling pin. Add more flour to the work surface and rolling pin if dough sticks.</li>
                <li>Keep rolled dough circles under a clean, damp kitchen towel until ready to fry.</li>
                <li>Set up stations of chopped lettuce, chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese, and any optional toppings you plan to use, and place in a convenient array for assembling the chalupas.</li>
                <li>Microwave refried beans on medium setting until soft and spreadable, about 1 minute, and add as the first station to your other ingredients.</li>
                <li>Warm shredded chicken briefly in the microwave or in a skillet, and toss with taco seasoning mix, and add as the second station to the other ingredients.</li>
                <li>To fry chalupa shells, add cooking oil to a depth of about 1/4-inch to a large, nonstick skillet. Heat oil over medium heat, and when the oil is hot, fry one side of one dough circle until lightly brown, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>To keep the bent shape, place fried chalupa shells into a taco holder until ready to fill.</li>
                <li>To serve, spread each chalupa shell with about 2 tablespoons refried beans, and fill with 2 or 3 tablespoons seasoned shredded chicken. Fill with lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese.</li>
                <li>Garnish with optional toppings, such as pico de gallo, sour cream, and sliced avocados, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
